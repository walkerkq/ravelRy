ravelRy is an R package that provides access to the [Ravelry API](https://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravelry-api).  

[Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/about) describes itself as _a place for knitters, crocheters, designers, spinners, weavers and dyers to keep track of their yarn, tools, project and pattern information, and look to others for ideas and inspiration._

## Installation

You can install the development version of ravelRy from Github with: 

``` r
devtools::install_github("walkerkq/ravelRy")
```

## Getting started    

1. Set up a Ravelry developer account at [https://www.ravelry.com/pro/developer](https://www.ravelry.com/pro/developer).  
2. Create an app with basic authentication: read only access.  
3. Set `RAVELRY_USERNAME` and `RAVELRY_PASSWORD` in your .renviron file or via the console with the `ravelry_auth()` function. 

```{r auth, eval = FALSE}
library(ravelRy)

ravelry_auth(key = 'username') 
# you will be prompted to enter your username via the console

ravelry_auth(key = 'password') 
# you will be prompted to enter your password via the console
```

### An example  

Retrieve a list of free patterns for baby hats.  

```{r example_search_patterns}
library(ravelRy)

search_results <- search_patterns(query = 'hat', page_size = 5, availability = 'free', fit = 'baby')
search_results
```

Get pattern details for those ids.  

```{r example_get_patterns}
patterns <- get_patterns(ids = search_results$id)
patterns
```
